# About Me
*My name is Aleksandr Trofimov, I'm a senior undergraduate student at MIT, majoring in
Chemistry and Computer Science, great to see you there! I'm interested in ways in
which software development and machine learning can augment research and development
in chemistry, in both industrial and academic environments. My other interests are
computational chemistry, HCI, and music.*

Some fun facts about me:
1. My favorite book is *The Gambler* by Fyodor Dostoevsky.
2. While my height suggests otherwise, I've never enjoyed playing basketball, but
   [handball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball) is honestly quite fun!
3. I'm really fond of silly cats.
