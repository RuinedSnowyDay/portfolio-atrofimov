# Exercise 3

## `PersonalAccessToken`

**concept** `PersonalAccessToken`\
**purpose** authenticate a user into the system using a github-generated token\
  rather than a password\
**principle**\
  User can generate a token, which is a random string that should be remembered by\
  the user as a password;\
  User can use the combination of the username and corresponding token (instead of\
  password) to authenticate into the system;\
**state**\
  a set of `User`s with\
    a `username` `String`\
    a set of `token` `String`s\
**actions**\
  `createToken` (`username`: `String`): (`token`: `String`)\
    **requires** nothing\
    **effects** if there is a `User` with the provided `username` in the set of\
      `User`s, then generates a new unique `token` `String` and adds it to the set of\
      `token` `String`s of the `User`. If there is no `User` with the provided\
      `username` in the set of `User`s, adds a new `User` with the provided\
      `username` and an empty set of `token` `String`s to the set of `User`s, and\
      then generates a new unique `token` `String` and adds it to the set of `token`\
      `String`s of the `User`. Returns the new `token` `String`.\
\
  `authenticate` (`username`: `String`, `token`: `String`): (`user`: `User`)\
    **requires** There is a `User` with the provided `username` in the set of\
      `User`s and the provided `token` is in the set of `token` `String`s of the\
      `User`\
    **effects** returns the authenticated `User` with the provided `username`.

## Differences between `PersonalAccessToken` and `PasswordAuthentication`

In `PasswordAuthentication` the user needs to come up with a password, while in
`PersonalAccessToken`, the generated personal access token is generated by the system
and should be remembered by the user as a password. There can also be multiple tokens
for the same user, which is not possible in `PasswordAuthentication`.

## GitHub page improvements

When I first created the GitHub access token, I was overwhelmed by the amount of
information on the description page, so I would suggest to improve it by adding a
tl;dr secetion for new and impatient users.
