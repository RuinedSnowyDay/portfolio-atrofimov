# Assignment 1
## Domains
+ **Mental health and well-being in the age of social media and AI**.
  Overreliance on social media, parasocial relationships, as well as atomization of
  social groups due to strong political and ideological polarization have made it hard
  to maintain a healthy and reliable support network, especially for young people, who
  additionally have to endure both academic and employment pressures. The problem is
  exacerbated for students, because their circles are frequently limited to their
  peers, who are often in the same situation. Therapy should be a solution to this,
  but there exist several barriers to starting it.
+ **Direction in studying and learning**. I and many other students find it interesting
  to learn about new topics, this is natural and good, but it is usally hard to find a
  good starting point, decide what's the final goal of learning about something, build
  a structured learning path, and find good resources for learning. This can lead to
  frustration and loss of interest, and it happened to me several times when trying to
  learn about new topics such as machine learning. System of higher education can help
  with this, but this help is often limited by the scope of classes, which rarely
  cover state-of-the-art topics and can be rigid.
+ **Efficient and pleasant typesetting**: many students, researchers, and
  engineers have to write math-heavy documents, such as homework assignments, research
  papers, documentation, etc. The most popular tool for this is LaTeX, which is a
  powerful markup language, but it has its downsides, such as a steep learning curve
  and a lack of interactive what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) interface. I
  personally tried to learn LaTeX since high school, but was only able to get a hand
  on it during my freshman year at the university. I spent a lot of time figuring out
  my personal config for automatic snippets and typesetting workflows, which is not
  ideal for such seemingly simple thing. My friend who is a math major told me that he
  doesn't really like LaTeX and other standard typesetting tools, because they are
  structured in a way that is very different from how one would write math on paper.
+ **Quantum chemical calculations**: quantum chemistry is a field of my scientific
  interest, I really enjoy learning the theoretica foundations of it, and building
  tools that implement these ideas. However, they sometimes look like black boxes and
  it is not clear what is the best method to use in a specific case, and even if there
  are some documented recommendations, it's hard to get a good intuition of why
  particular methods work better in some cases.
+ **Small attention span and many distractions in the digital age**: there are many
  sources of distractions today, that can lead to procrastination and inefficient use
  of time.
+ **LLMs are great, but there is a large variety of them**: contemporary LLM
  benchmarks are exhaustive in their own ways, but are also vague and too technical
  (and also models are sometimes overtrained to excel at these benchmarks), general
  audience needs an illustrative and intuitive set of benchmarks to compare different
  models and determine which is best for their specific use cases.
+ **Active and efficient learning requires repetition and drilling**: I personally use
  flashcards to learn vocabulary in foreign languages and to remember facts like
  major and minor scales in music, but some disciplines, such as programming, require
  more complex and interactive exercises, and I would prefer to make them
  customizable rather than use a fixed set of exercises, e.g. from a learning app.
+ **Choosing public spaces, such as libraries, cafes, etc, to work at**: I love
  working outside of my dorm, because I can submerge myself into a working environment
  and reduce self-distraction; however, it is sometimes hard to pick a right place to
  work, as my preference depends on many feature: crowdedness, access to monitor,
  presence of collaborative study rooms etc.
+ **Longevity for non-academia people**: more and more people are interested in
  prolonging their lifespan, but the information is spread across many sources
  (research papers, youtube videos, news, etc), so it is hard to keep track of current
  progress in a field, navigate different sources and opinions, and be able to
  distinguish between reasonable and biased claims.
+ **Expanding the span of music preferences**: I enjoy listening to music and learning
  about new genres and styles; for casual listening I use music recommendation
  systems, and they work fine, but they restrict the variety of music I listen to,
  since the recommendations are based on my previous listening history.
+ **Effective handling of jetlag**: travelling across very different time zones is
  stressful on its own, but the jetlag makes it even worse, and fixing it requires
  disciplined effort and planning.

My domains of choice are:
1. *Mental health and well-being for students in the age of social media and AI*. This
   is an interesting domaing for me for multiple reasons. First, I'm really interested
   in psychiatry and psychology, I've read several books on these topics trying to
   understand myself and what is the best way to help my friends. Secondly, I think
   that my life would have been a lot better if I started therapy earlier, so I'm
   willing to create non-annoying and effective tools to help students start therapy.
   Finally, I can observe that LLMs have an ambivalent effect on mental health domain:
   on one hand, there is direct evidence that they can mitigate symptoms of anxiety and
   depression, but on the other hand, the misuse of LLMs can exacerbate social
   isolation and give harmful advice. Also, I personally experienced interacting with
   people who used LLMs while having mental health issues, and I could observe how
   LLMs made their situation worse.
2. *Direction in study and learning*. Recently I've read a book called *Ultralearning* by
   Scott Young, which describes the approaches and strategies of efficient
   self-directed learning. It strongly resonated with me, because I saw many of these
   strategies in how I used to learn new topics when I was in high school, but from
   which I strayed away when I entered university. I tried to learn many different
   things on my own, from machine learning to organometallic chemistry, but failed due
   to the lack of structure, clear goals, and discipline.
3. *Efficient and pleasant typesetting*. I'm interested in this domain, because I come
   from scientific background, and the language of communications in science is
   papers. There are some requirements for writing papers, and one of which is to use
   LaTeX. Learning to use it was a long road for me, but even a longer road was to
   figure out how to make its usage more ergonomic and efficient, so that I can focus
   on the intellectual work, rather than the intricacies of the language. With this
   experience, I could clearly see the pain points of LaTeX, and maybe I can come up
   with something useful, maybe even for other typesetting languages.

## Problems
### Mental health and well-being in the age of social media and AI
**Problem 1**: *The misuse of LLMs for mental health support*. While LLMs are good for
professional and casual conversations, thay can't replace real people when dealing
with personal and mental health issues, which is a problem given their abundance and
availability.

**Problem 2:** *Parasocial interactions disrupt social connections*.
[Parasocial relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction) are
a relatively new concept, describing relationships that people form with personas
existing in media sphere, such as famous people, influencers, streamers, etc. These
can act as a strong substitute for real social connections, especially for introverted
people, which can be detrimantal to their mental health.

**Problem 3**: *Barriers to starting therapy*.
There are many barriers to starting therapy such as cost, inconvenience, long waiting
times, stigma, and, as in my personal experience, the fear of making a leap of faith
and trying it for the first time.

### Direction in studying and learning
**Problem 1**: *Searching for and creating structured learning paths*.
It is hard not only to find good starting point for learning about a new topic, but
also to figure out how to proceed further and reach the desired level of proficiency.


**Problem 2**: *Setting up disciplined learning routines and sticking to them*.
The lack of self-organization and discipline is a common problem for many people who
are trying to learn something on their own. The reasons for that can be different:
from poor time management to not truly understanding and embracing why one wants to
learn specific things.

**Problem 3**: *Tracking the progress of learning*.
Essential part that motivates people to learn is that the progress should be visible
and measurable. This is especially important for self-directed learning, when there
are no such things as exams, grades, or other external ways to assess the progress.

### Efficient and pleasant typesetting
**Problem 1**: *LaTeX is morally and technically outdated*.
LaTeX was created in 1980s, and it is still widely used today. However, it has many
parts that one could consider non-ergonomic and outdated, such as the lack of
interactive interfaces, slow compilation times, unintuitive and verbose syntax, and
the package configuration process that brings a lot of pain.

**Problem 2**: *Integrating AI tools into the typesetting workflow*.
AI agents permeated the ecosystem of software development tools, and their emergence
requires rethinking the workflows of many simple tasks, such as tracking the progress
or debugging, so one can expect that soon, when the LLMs will be even more powerful,
such tools may become a demand for efficient writing and typesetting as well.

**Problem 3**: *Typesetting math is very different from writing math on paper*.
When one writes math on paper, they can create empty spaces for symbols or formulas,
quickly jump between one part of the formula to another, and instantly see the result
of their writing. In LaTeX, what one writes is very different from what one sees in
the final output, and also because of the long compilation times, it is hard to
instantly see the result of one's work, which can be frustrating, especially under
time pressure, as in the case of typesetting lecture notes or homework assignments, or
even when just exploring new ideas.

### My choice of problems
1. *The misuse of LLMs for mental health support*. This problem is interesting because
   it is very relevant and ambivalent: on one hand, LLMs can be helpful for people who
   experience mild stress or need to vent, but on the other hand, they can give
   harmful advice, exacerbate social isolation, and prevent people from seeking real
   help. It is also impossible to prevent people from using LLMs in this way on the
   level of chatbot providers, so the solution to this should be constructive, not
   prohibitive. They tend to agree with the user, and depending on the input prompt or
   fine-tuning data, they can give harmful advice, maybe even harmful to other people
   (see [emergent misalignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424))
2. *Searching for and creating structured learning paths*. I like this problem,
   because it allows for generalization of interactive and structured approaches, that
   are observed only in certain areas. For specific topics, such as programming,
   there are many resources and tutorials that can help with this, e.g.
   [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) that provides a whole roadmap for preparing for
   coding interviews, but it is limited to problems that are created and hosted on
   LeetCode platform and lacks customization and misses the social aspect of learning,
   replacing it with a fixed set of exercises. Roadmaps for learning other topics are
   either more vague, or not interactive and static, and sometimes even nonexistent.
3. *Typesetting math is very different from writing math on paper*. I'm really
   interested in this problem, because I personally went through the nine circles of
   hell iterating multiple times to find a workflow that would work for me, and also
   it is interesting to compare the intellectual value of taking notes using pen and
   paper versus typesetting them. There are many possibilities to explore here, from
   web-apps similar to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to embedded plug-ins that
   provide interactive assistance while writing in LaTeX. One thing that would be
   interesting to emulate is the Microsoft Word's equation editor, which provides a
   WYSIWYG interface for writing math, but it is not flexible and powerful enough to
   be used seriously (though I had used it for a whole term once!)

### The problems I *didn't choose*
+ *Parasocial interactions disrupt social connections*. While this problem is
  interesting, it can create kind of a dependency loop, where people who are already
  struggling with social connections will try to use an app to fix their situation,
  but the app itself may become a source of parasocial interactions, so the solution
  to this problem should be more systemic, involving in-person interactions and
  potentially assistance from specialists.
+ *Barriers to starting therapy*. This problem is also interesting, but it is very
  multifaceted, and the solution to it should include many aspects, such as message
  framing, cost reduction, convenience, and motivation, so it is hard to tackle it in
  a simple way.
+ *Setting up disciplined learning routines and sticking to them*. This problem is
  important, but there are two problems. Firstly, it is very personal, and it is hard
  to come up with a solution that would work for many people. Secondly, there are
  already many organizational apps that can help with this, such as Notion, many
  variations of to-do lists, calendar apps, etc.
+ *Tracking the progress of learning*. As well as the previous problem, this one is
  very personal and depends on the specific topic one is learning, so it is hard to
  generalize the procedure of tracking the progress. Maybe LLMs could help with
  generating quizzes and exercises, but it is not much different from just prompting
  it to a chat interface.
+ *LaTeX is morally and technically outdated*. This problem is very broad, and
  requires literally creating a new typesetting language, which is a huge task. This
  task is not impossible, and there are efforts in this direction already, such as
  [typst](https://typst.app/)
+ *Integrating AI tools into the typesetting workflow*. This problem is very
  prospective, because LLMs are still not perfect at writing highly technical novel
  documents, and the development of such tools would require expertise from AI,
  typesetting, and scientific writing domains, so it is unbearably hard to do it
  alone.

## Stakeholders
1. *Misuse of LLMs for mental health support*
   + People who are struggling with mental health issues and are looking for support
     and advice, but can't get professional help.
   + Mental health professionals, who can either benefit from people getting into
     therapy because of the positive experience with LLMs (or people who got harmful
     advice from LLMs and now need more help), or can lose clients to LLMs.
   + Providers of LLMs, who can be interested in fine-tuning their models to be more
     helpful and less harmful, or who can potentially be held accountable for the harm
     caused by their models.
2. *Searching for and creating structured learning paths*
   + Students and self-learners, who need to build a mental map or a roadmap for their
     learning projects, and can benefit from other people's shared roadmaps.
   + Educational institutions, who can experience a shift in how students learn, and
     how people use their publicly available resources.
   + App that provide similar roadmaps for studying, and educational apps in general.
3. *Typesetting math is very different from writing math on paper*
   + Students, researchers, and engineers, who are constantly dealing with writing
     highly technical documents, or just want to take notes in a more efficient way.
   + Providers of typesetting tools, such as Overleaf, who can benefit from
     integrating interactive typesetting features into their platforms, or lose
     users because of the emergence of better tools.
   + Educational institutions, who can benefit from students and educators being able
     to more easily typeset assignments, lecture notes, and other documents.

## Evidence
### Misuse of LLMs for mental health support
+ [Dartmouth University](https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIoa2400802)
  conducted a clinical trial of a therapy chatbot, which showed promising results for
  treating major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and clinically
  high risk for feeding and eating disorders.
+ This [Phychiatric Times](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/preliminary-report-on-chatbot-iatrogenic-dangers)
  article discusses the potential dangers of using chatbots and points to the lack of
  oversight from mental health professionals in this area.
+ [This viewpoint](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589750024002553)
  provides model-agnostic guidelines for the responsible use of LLMs in mental health
  care.
+ This [Stanford Prepring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18412) points out that current
  publically available chat bots have stigma towards mental health issues, and can
  provide inappropriate care, e.g. encourage delusional thinking.
+ There is an [open investigation](https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-investigates-meta-and-characterai-misleading-children-deceptive-ai)
  that looks whether Meta and Character.ai are violating consumer protection laws by
  inappropriately marketing their AI chatbots as a source of mental health support.
+ Some people become
  [emotionally dependent](https://www.reddit.com/r/replika/comments/18661bt/emotional_dependence/)
  on their AI companions, which can be harmful to their mental health.
+ There a stories of people who commited suicide, potentially because of
  [AI psychosis](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/what-to-know-about-ai-psychosis-and-the-effect-of-ai-chatbots-on-mental-health)

### Searching for and creating structured learning paths
+ Existence of such projects as [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) and their success
  suggests that this approach is popular and effective
+ From *Ultralearning* by Scott Young, building a mind map and a path to the
  goal of learning is essential for learning new things.
+ [Training roadmaps](https://www.togetherplatform.com/blog/what-is-a-training-roadmap-definition-types-and-benefits)
  for employees were shown to increase productivity and job performance.
+ Building roadmaps can help [in research](https://scholarlyintegrity.princeton.edu/students/cultivating-study-habits/research-process-roadmap)
  by splitting the large project into many manageable steps
+ Access to other people's roadmaps leverages
  [cooperative learning](https://www.nshss.org/resources/blog/blog-posts/5-benefits-of-collaborative-learning-strategies-how-to-get-started/)
  which is shown to be effective
+ People discuss that while roadmaps are useful, they sometimes can be too
  [opinionated and subjective](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jjtfog/are_roadmaps_still_relevant/)
+ Roadmaps help visualize the big picture of learning projects, which
  [helps in the process itself](https://drieam.com/en/guides/visualization-of-the-learning-process/)

### Typesetting math is very different from writing math on paper
+ LaTeX is widely popular in academia and science
+ Online typesetting tools such as Overleaf are widely used and
  mitigate some of the pain points of LaTeX, particularly with the math typesetting
+ Non-ergonomic parts of LaTeX led to the usage of special plugins that make
  writing math equations faster, check [this blog](https://castel.dev/)
+ People still widely use Microsoft Word's equation editor, despite its
  limitations, because of its WYSIWYG interface
+ It has been shown that handwritten notes are
  [better](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11943480/) for learning than
  typed, and math typesetting in LaTeX in its current form is even more different from
  handwriting than just typing plain text
+ There are attempts to create interactive WYSIWYG math editors, such as
  [Mathcha](https://www.mathcha.io/), but they produce results that are not visually
  appealing, not flexible enough, and potentially can be incompatible with LaTeX
+ There are attempts to create new typesetting languages, such as
  [Typst](https://typst.app/), that make math setting more ergonomic, but they
  still share similar issue of the lack of interactivity

## Features
### Misuse of LLMs for mental health support
#### Assesment feature
LLMs can be used to asses the mental state of the user, by asking them a series of
questions, and then providing feedback on their mental state. This can determine
whether the user needs professional help, or whether they can benefit from self-help
or support from AI chatbot.

#### Psychological benchmarks feature
The app can present current performance of different LLMs on psychological
benchmarks, which could help users make a more informed choice of which model to use for
mental health support.

#### Chat bot with LLM fine-tuned for mental health support
The app can provide a chat bot that is fine-tuned for mental health support, and
that can provide appropriate responses to users who are struggling with mental health
issues. The chat bot should also be designed to aviod giving harmful advice, and to
encourage users to seek professional help when needed.

## Searching for and creating structured learning paths
#### Roadmap creation feature
The app can provide a feature that allows users to create their own learning
roadmaps, by specifying the topic they want to learn, the final goal, the connections
between different subtopics, resources for learning, and benchmarks for assessing the
progress.

#### Roadmap sharing feature
The app can provide a feature that allows users to share their learning roadmaps with
other users, and to browse and search for roadmaps created by other users. Optionally,
users should also be able to share their progress on the roadmaps they are following.

#### Roadmup discussion feature
Users should be able to discuss roadmaps, ask questions, and provide feedback on
others' roadmaps, which can help improve the quality of the roadmaps and promote
cooperative learning.

## Typesetting math is very different from writing math on paper
#### Interactive math editor feature
The app can provide an interactive math editor that allows users to write math
as in Microsoft Word's equation editor, but with LaTeX math code produced in
real time

#### Online LaTeX compilation feature
The app can provide an online LaTeX compilation feature that allows users to
compile their LaTeX documents and get PDF as an output, potentially with a preview.

#### Collaborative editing feature
The app can provide a collaborative editing feature that allows multiple users
to work on the same LaTeX document simultaneously, similar to Overleaf.
